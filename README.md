# NpcConversations

This project was created with a certain idea in mind. The idea is that, if you're a game maker (or a wannabe, doesn't matter), you have lots of ideas for your stuff. You don't always have your PC or laptop on you - which is where yo do most of the work on the game. You're on a bus or on a plane, or wherever. You wittness a funny situation and think 'Oh, this should appear in the dialogue somewhere'. So what do you do? You open OneNote, create a page and jot it down. You come back home, you open your editor (if you have one), you create the stuff from OneNote, save, compile, run.

## What if I told you...

There's an app for that? Imagine the same funny situation. You pull out your phone. You open an app, create a new NPC named Harold, and create some dialogues for him. You play the dialogue over to check if it 'feels' right. Then you think, 'Hmm, this could be a side quest, actually.' So you switch to the Quests tab and create one, simple as that. You come back home, you export the game content into a JSON file, you load it into your game, boom. You can create NPCs, factions, dialogues, quests and questlines, items, containers, doors, map markers, magic, etc - basically everything except the physical world.

## Running/testing the app

Run `npm start` for a dev server.
Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests.
